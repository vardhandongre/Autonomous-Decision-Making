# Resnet.ipynb

A very deep convolutional network using Residual Networks.  Residual Networks, introduced by He et al., allow us to train much deeper networks than were previously practically feasible.In this code, the basic building blocks of ResNets. were implemented. The building blocks were put together and a state-of-the-art neural network for image classification was trained.
